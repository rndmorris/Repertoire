Target Audience
- [ ] As a language learning support tool
  - [ ] With its pre-loaded libraries of language cards, Repertoire serves as an intuitive, enjoyable approach to reinforcement language instruction.  With a study mode -- where the user can study virtual flash cards to help with memorizing non-phonetic ideograms -- and a game mode -- where the user can work on learning ideograms through a flash card game -- users are empowered to choose how they learn a second, or subsequent, language.

- [ ] As a platform for general subject learning
  - [ ] With its customizable card deck creation, Repertoire can support any type of learning for a student of any subject.  Users can create decks of custom cards for study or play to help them reinforce recall of pertinent facts.  Here's a small set of potential deck sets
    - [ ] For the amateur lepidopterist: create a butterfly deck to reinforce your field identification skills
    - [ ] For the computer scientist: create a decimal to hexadecimal base deck to reinforce your skills at different number bases
    - [ ] For the advanced math student: create a derivative rules deck to help memorize how to take those pesky derivatives depending on the expressions being evaluated
    - [ ] For the nursing student: create an anatomy deck to help commit assorted organs and bones to memory
