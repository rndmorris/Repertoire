Target Audience
- [ ] As a language learning support tool
  - [ ] With its pre-loaded libraries of language cards, Repertoire serves as an intuitive, enjoyable approach to reinforcement language instruction.  With a study mode - where the user can study virtual flash cards to help with memorizing non-phonetic ideograms - and a game mode - where the user can work on learning ideograms through a flash card game - users are empowered to choose how they learn a second, or subsequent, language.

- [ ] As a platform for general subject learning
  - [ ] With its customizable card deck creation, Repertoire can support any type of learning for a student of any subject.  Users can create decks of custom cards for study or play to help them reinforce recall of pertinent facts.  Here's a small set of potential deck sets
    - [ ] For the amateur lepidopterist: create a butterfly deck to reinforce your field identification skills
    - [ ] For the computer science student: create a decimal to hexadecimal base deck to reinforce your skills at different number bases
    - [ ] For the advanced math student: create a derivative rules deck to help memorize how to take those pesky derivatives depending on the expressions being evaluated
    - [ ] For the nursing student: create an anatomy deck to help commit assorted organs and bones to memory


Feature List
- [ ] The application's feature include:
    - [ ] a game mode to work on subject mastery
    - [ ] a study mode to review your subject at your pace
    - [ ] customizable dictionaries, you can study any subject, any time

If correct, the mastery bar is incremented; if incorrect, the mastery bar is cleared and the card is returned to the unmastered deck.  If the mastery bar increment fills the mastery bar completely, the card is moved to the user's mastered deck.  The user continues playing by clicking on an unmastered card or makes a different selection from the menu.
